    "### Objectives\n",
    " * Use CrowPi IoT kit to access the Raspberry Pi\n",
    " * Create a new Python application\n",
    " * Create a simple game using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: This lab is based on NetAcad IoT Connecting Things 3.2.5.9 Lab Writing Simple Python Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "Python is one of the most commonly used languages for developing new rapid prototyping solutions. It can be used to create web applications, desktop applications, and more. Python is also extensively used in Data Science to analyze Big Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted computer language, and does not require compiling. It is platform independent and can run on Linux, Windows, OsX, and other systems. Python programs can be written using any text editor and should have the extension .py.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a basic introduction to programming Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Resources \n",
    " * Computer configured with Jupyter notebooks"
