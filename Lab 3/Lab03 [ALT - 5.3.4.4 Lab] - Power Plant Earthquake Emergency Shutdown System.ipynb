    "## \tBackground / Scenario \n",
    "This lab demonstrates the use of HTTP based REST API calls to integrate third party services into your application. You will learn how to store and retrieve JSON data in a MongoDB database running in the cloud, build applications that store the device state in a central place, and build multiple clients that can react based on the stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is an open source NoSQL document-oriented database that directly maps to applications. It provides a mechanism allowing the integration of data in certain types of applications to become much easier and faster. While it has native support for most programming languages, this lab will for simplicity use an HTTP based REST API access to an mLab hosted MongoDB instance (https://www.mongodb.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "The application simulates a simplified factory emergency shutdown system where a single control board can be used by an operator to update the state of an alarm variable in a central database. Multiple emergency client boards periodically check for the alarm property value and trigger an alarm on an external electrical system. For simplicity in this lab you will only be turning on or off LEDs. In real world practice, the control boards could turn off gas pumps, close fire doors, or perform other vital tasks."
